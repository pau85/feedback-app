The Feedback Form application is a way for visitors to share their feedback on the pau85.github.io website. As a developer, I am always open to constructive feedback and improving my work and so I wanted to make it possible for visitors to leave feedback.

1/20/2025
This project has been started today, and may possibly be deployed to pau85.github.io. 

Plan for project initial launch:
Set up interface for form with validation.
Set submit button to write all entered data to text file.
Set up link on top navigation and on homepage to encourage feedback from visitors.

Future Enhancements:
All feedback will be privately sent to a text file for now, but I plan to create a SQLite database in DBeaver to log the messages and then display them on the same Feedback page once approved by me.
I will also be creating a trigger from the database with some form of a downstream execution to inform myself of the feedback once it is submitted.
